Computer Components/Architecture

IPO - IPO is a basic acronym representing the basics of an information system. It is also an abstract way of describing the structure of a system or an algorithm. 

Input -> Process -> Output

The entity receives some input, processes it, and produces some output
The model can represent a total system - like a phone - or a single aspect of the system, like a button on an app
A practical aspect of this model is that if you standardize the inputs and outputs, then how exactly the data is processed is not important
Sometimes a feedback loop from output to process and a storage to process back & forth can be added to extend the basic IPO model
Some storage might be used as a cache
A feedback loop represents an output from one process being inputted again, potentially for a recursion or for another process
